:warning: ignore in-code testing, it's a pre-delta-version and i didn't even made tests yet :warning:


# Concept

- Each user can ping some activity(programming, writting, listening, etc.), by the name it's means to be only about coding, but on the core it's not the only functionality.

- Each ping is binded to it's sender, e.g. if programming the sender is a editor.
- Each ping is binded to the OS where the activity was generated.
- Each ping has a descriptor, e.g. if programming the descriptor is a language.
- Each ping can belong to an environment, e.g. if programming the environment can be the project name and the branch

- Sender is an abstract object which has a type e.g. editor, player, software, platform, etc.
- Descriptor is an abstract object which has a metadata about something e.g. language, song, info, etc.

- Each user will rise points doing pings
- Each ping will rise points on it's main activity on user profile, e.g. programming
- Each ping will rise points on it's descriptor on user profile, e.g. programming language

- Points will become level by some freaking formulae that will be explained on the future
- Activities are hardcoded, since each activity has it's own particularities however there will be a generic activity with a generic descriptor

- Remember first things first, so, coding related stuffs will be made first.
